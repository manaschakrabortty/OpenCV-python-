1. Importing OpenCV:- The code starts with importing the OpenCV library, which is used for computer vision tasks.

2. Initializing Face Cascade Classifier:- A pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for detecting frontal faces is loaded. 
This classifier is a machine learning-based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images.
Here, the path to the XML file containing the pre-trained classifier is provided.

3. Initializing Video Capture:- The code initializes video capturing from the default camera (webcam). This is done using the "VideoCapture()" function.

4. Looping for Video Capture and Face Detection:- A while loop is set up to continuously capture frames from the video feed.

5. Reading Frames:- Inside the loop, the read() function is used to capture a frame (video_data) from the video feed.

6. Converting Frame to Grayscale:- The captured frame is converted to grayscale. This is because face detection often works better in grayscale
 images and reduces computational complexity.

7. Face Detection:- The "detectMultiScale() " function is used to detect faces in the grayscale frame. It takes several parameters like scaleFactor, minNeighbors, and minSize. 
These parameters control how the algorithm operates. It returns a list of rectangles where faces are detected.

8. Drawing Rectangles Around Detected Faces:- For each detected face, a rectangle is drawn around it using the "rectangle()" function.
    This helps visualize where the faces are in the video feed.
   
9.Breaking the Loop:- If the letter 'a' is pressed on the keyboard (using waitKey() function), the loop breaks and the program terminates.

10.Releasing Resources: Finally, when the loop breaks, the video capture object is released to free up resources.


SUMMARY- This code continuously captures video frames from the webcam, detects faces in each frame, draws rectangles around the detected faces, 
and displays the processed frames in real-time until the 'a' key is pressed.
